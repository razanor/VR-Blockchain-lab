var picDescription = ["Metamorphoses are transformations. Transformation of the flow \
created by one person, an anonym we do not know at all. In his hands there is a Blockchain, \
people who work on it and create these things that are self-confident and promote this subject. \
The work shows how it happens. As self-confident people continue to engrain it in \
our world. The second part of the work reflects our world: as everything is told and \
displayed to the other people, who are not particularly aware of what it is and how it is. \
And now they have more open eyes on these things, they have some thoughts on this topic.",

"The author investigates the topic of interconnection of everyday phenomena with \
the space through his art. He decided to cross the borders of our planet and \
demonstrate the Blockchain technology from the astronaut's point of view. \
Everything in this world is constantly moving. The dynamic is the law of development. \
The arrows around the planet symbolize the constant progress of the new Blockchain \
technology as well as unhindered exchange of benefits and energy. This work demonstrates \
the opportunity of direct communications and the transparency of relationships that are \
guaranteed by the new technology. The basis of the sculpture is a metal welded frame. The metal \
elements were made separately — the globe and the arrows. The space was reproduced with a cinder \
(the product of coal processing) and a coal, which is stretched on metal wires.",

"The author tried to reflect the psychological state of a person who has just got \
to know the latest technologies of Blockchain. We can see the person has not become \
embarrassed: the sight became more attentive, sharp. In the eyes we can see the \
space of practical ideas. And the color has become a distinct form of integrity organization.",

'Bitcoin has opened up for the artist as a certain symbol that money is not just a material \
substance. The concept of "money" is the interaction of male and female energy. Exploring the \
subject, the author conducts an analogy of the circulation of water in the atmosphere and threeb \
levels of depth of people’s relationships. Water can be in an ocean (the relationships are \
closer to the shore and at the bottom), steam, or may just penetrate the sand on the shore \
(like a corruption). Bitcoin is when you do not need to spend on services (clothing) and at \
the same time transparently (at a depth without corruption). What is behind the horizon of \
the ocean and what deeper levels of relationships can humanity turn out of, if not spent on \
the service? Perhaps, Bitcoin is just a pointer to something much deeper behind the horizon of \
the ocean of people’s relationships?',

"This is a picture of the radiation spectrum of gold, \
the forefather of monetary units. The fact that there are only lines of certain \
colors in the spectrum means that this atom emits a light of certain frequencies. \
These frequencies are connected with distribution of electrons in an atom and \
are unique for each element. The artist set himself the goal to connect color \
and chemical definitions on a subconscious level to get a versatile, thus, \
more completed sensitive perception of what surrounds us.",

'Nowadays, the technological progress has reached enormous proportions, and what \
seemed impossible is real now. Each new invention becomes a peculiar link, which \
helps to create something in the future. It is an endless process. \
Blockchain, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also a kind of step, because \
now they are something relatively new, and nobody knows, what kind of development \
is waiting for these technologies in future. The author expresses a wish to see, \
what they will be transformed into and what kind of influence they will have on our lives.',

'Such things as Bitcoin and Blockchain more and more become the subjects of many discussions \
of the present. At the state level, most of countries still have not decided what a bitcoin \
is in its essence. The public opinion on this issue generates even more discrepancies. \
A picture "The New Age Masons" reflects the global issue, what the blockchain is — an \
instrument which is given people for overpassing to a new level of interaction without \
distrust and suspicions or an instrument for manipulation of people.',

'The chthonic deity Civilization holds in its hands the most up-to-date gifts: a smartphone \
that embodies the connection and access to the network, and bitcoins, the most significant \
and well-known cryptocurrency. Behind the deity there is a planet with metropolises that \
are connected with each other. This is the embodiment of civilization, and the symbolic \
picture of the Blockchain technology. \
Black colors dominate on the canvas — the colors of the universe, the emptiness which everything \
arose from: mankind, its ideas and gods, its technologies and cities — in short, civilization. \
Gold is a color of money, welfare and divine power. In turn, bronze was one of the most important \
metals for mankind. Now it has become a symbol of metropolises. The galaxy in the form of an eye \
above the head of a goddess which in addition is a halo symbolizes the eternity and globality of \
the universe, as well as the significance of the development of mankind in this system. The work \
unites the past, the present and the future, demonstrating the causal relationships of these concepts. \
But we should not forget that everything comes from nothing — from the source of human thought and imagination. \
Just as the upraise of Blockchain technology.',

'The artist deeply understood the essence of the bitcoin. In his opinion, he lit this brand new light \
— a star of Blockchain. The decision of the artist: it is necessary to invest. During the presentation \
of the work the jury expressed the opinion that inevitably will come the time when under this picture \
there will be an initiation in the jedi, knights of the bitcoin. \
The author chose the main colors of gold and blue, and the work has become magnificent. Blue is the \
color of the sky. Gold is money. Such web is a vision of close interaction of everything. Red honeycombs \
symbolize the human community under the rule of the bitcoin. The artist hopes they will increase with every second. \
According to the author, he has made an advertising poster attracting people\'s attention. \
«While somebody is waiting for something in vain, others invest and earn».',

'At first, The Obscurity and The Chaos dominated. And He created the cryptoanarchists. And they gave birth to \
thoughts. And the newborn meanings flow out of the darkness of the darknet. They started to connect into chains, \
to create new ones, even more complex. So there was a Blockchain. The chains multiplied, became noticeable, \
again and again they interflow into big blocks which spread on the internet spaces like circles. So there was \
a new Harmony which started to dominate in the Universe!',

'According to the principle of bitcoin and Blockchain work, the author figured out a non-digital algorithm using \
which the true name and characteristics of the canvas were encoded, divided into boxes, connected by the chain and \
wrapped in the outlines of the picture. \
In the opinion of the artist, the picture reveals the essence of cryptocurrency, IT and the mechanized world which we \
live in. After all, the generation of zero-zero is closely related to technologies. People become smarter, so why can’t \
the art get a "smart" status? \
So the author encodes all her paintings to let them go easier. Without using the computer the algorithm cannot be solved. \
A person who has never seen a PC won\’t be able to get it.',

"Perhaps, somebody hasn't noticed, but future has already come. It isn't as bright as they promised but it's possible to live in. \
Perhaps, somebody has forgotten, but art isn't about mind, it's about feelings. It's not about answers but about questions. It is as useless as an air. \
It is interesting, that Blockchain technology works only in the presence of a voltage of 220 V. The same as electric iron Rowenta. \
By the way, the last one was invented by a person who was disagree with outdated technologies of ironing. Those, who are disagree, move the world forward. \
Besides, as everyone knows, the world survived because he laughed. And sometimes even giggled. \
A useful piece of advice: do not hide bitcoin under a mattress. Thieves rummage there first of all..",

'The artist turned to the famous plot of the Renaissance, depicting the creation of a new financial system based on Blockchain. \
Tongues in the style of pop-art are a variety of languages that implement algorithms of the new monetary policy. \
Gold will always be associated with money, even in the era of informational technologies. One of the features of Lydiya’s paintings \
is rich colors. According to the artist, it is the best way to show the brightness and irregularity of life.',

'The author creates a collection of works with the general name "Universum". The meaning is to compile everything incompatible. \
For the artist Blockchain looks like a structure, composed of heterogeneous elements. Where you can buy and sell paintings through \
smart-contracts. For this banking system there are plenty of variants. \
At first, the artist downloaded different Medias to create a one work, later he started to filtrate them. And it made sense. On the \
painting author depicted people who wander looking for the sense of the Blockchain technology. Some of them understand where they \
are now, other ones do not. The author believes that the modern system is ambivalent perceived in the world just like that.',

'Blockchain-technologies are a colorful image of other world perceptions, an incentive to create new forms of relationships and \
interactions between people. The painting "New connection" is a symbolic reflection of a new reality, in which a person faces \
the need to find harmonious forms of spiritual development with the rapid advancement of technologies. \
Lack of emotions, higher mathematical calculation, clear and transparent structure of connections are on the one hand and the \
search for higher meaning, spiritual revelation are on the other. \
Black is a symbol of the unknown, the mystery, the depths. \
Yellow is a symbol of spiritual development, divine solar energy.\
A human is in the center, at the intersection of the spiritual vertical and horizontal of new technologies. \
A new challenge. A new reality that captures with space rings and unites people of the future.',

'The future has already come! Behind a complicated and insufficiently understandable mechanism of the Blockchain there is an open \
and convenient system of exchange of benefits — without agents and juridical delays. This technology will give each of us an \
opportunity to jump over from the ineffective bureaucratic system of cohabitation with the native country to a modern, accommodative, \
trustworthy system with a motto "Country is me" just like using the time machine.',

'Chaos comes to destroy outdated outlooks and rules, the laws of existence and life... This is what happens now in our society: \
sometimes it is necessary to subject the old system of stress, sort it into pieces, change the usual flow of time to find a new \
balance of life! So chaos is not an emptiness, it\'s a birth of a new world! And the picturesque chaos is exactly about \
the new position of things after the "explosive" intervention of something new into the familiar world of things.',

'"The Concept" project represents a transparent spatial object that appeals to the transparency of Blockchain technology, virtuality, \
immateriality of bitcoin, which has no physical dimension. \
The object, which is an algebraic surface, is given by the equation of the nth degree, referring to the spatial model of the Kalabi-Yau \
six-dimensional space, describes the nature of the Blockchain technology created by a mathematical design chronologically programmed \
in a "chain" using complex algebraic algorithms. \
This is a spatial experiment where the interaction between micro- and macrosystems, between the physical and virtual worlds explores \
the diversity of modern phenomena. \
In order to reveal a transparent object, a light ray that pulses in the rhythm of human’s heart is directed at it, and, having fallen \
on a picturesque canvas — a black square, causes the appearance of a polar light on its surface. \
Due to the fact that we do not know for sure whether cryptocurrency is the future of mankind or a well-developed speculative scheme, \
the picturesque part of "The Concept" appeals to the work of the pioneer of the conceptual art Kazimir Malevich "Black Square" as a \
modernist symbol of the absolute. \
The colored square is "ArtCoin", a qualitatively innovative cryptocurrency of the future, which will measure the growth of human’s \
individuality.',

'This work is the result of the author’s research of intersections and parallels between the main principles of Blockchain technology \
and the aesthetic principles of art. Blockchain is a story about communication without intermediaries. The main principle of \
abstraction is the direct connection of elements with each other. That is, each composition component cannot exist without the \
agreement with the system, as well as within Blockchain, each block of information cannot function detached from others. Therefore, \
the artist chose the abstraction as the most appropriate solution of the problem of projection of Blockchain technology into the \
world of art. This work is not a reflection of the latest technology, but an expression of the principle of its action.',

'Improvisation on the theme "Black Square" by Malevich. The artist tries to portray the place of Blockchain technology in the modern \
world and its all-embracing nature. The subjectity of a person in this process and her choice points to the bridge between the past \
and the future: in fact, K. Malevich worked in the era of industrial revolution. We are watching the times of innovation revolution. \
These time slices have common issues. They relate to technologies, the victory of the new over the old and the role of human in the \
modern world.',

'Art-Hackathon\'s first day for the artist was oversaturated with information. As a result, there was a fairly voluminous understanding \
of technology of Blockchain and its breed — Bitcoin. But the author failed to make a definitive conclusion: are these inventions of IT \
thought ethical and useful or harmful and dangerous. As an ordinary internet user, the artist had thought about its dark side — darknet \
just a little. It turned out that such advanced technologies as Blockchain originated somewhere on the border of the dark and light \
sides of the World Wide Web. And darknet itself, which is associated with something illegal, played a major role in the development of \
Blockchain and cryptocurrency. As a result, we have a living mechanism that continuously generates new links, growing and expanding, \
covering all the new realms of human life.',

'In front of you there is an attempt to simulate the world of the future, where IT-technologies will become an integral component of people\'s \
lives. At present Blockchain, bitcoin and cryptocurrency are becoming real. As history shows, each invention has two sides. Chains that pierce \
our world symbolize Blockchain and remain that we will be bound by threads that make it easy to control humanity. Depicted eye \
symbolizes clarity of transactions of cryptocurrency but we don\'t know for sure who operates new technologies and who looks after \
these processes of implementation. Despite all this, the author hopes that in such a complex world there will be enough space for \
humanity.',

'What do you need to put your fingers in a socket? \
A FAITH that you will get the superpowers. \
A COURAGE to pay the price of the risk, not knowing for sure, whether you will get these powers. \
AN ACTION after which you will know everything on your own experience. \
For somebody it may be useless or even dangerous, while another one will open the world in a new way.',

'An idea was formed as a set of data which provides the choice of one specific cryptographic vision. The composition forms asymmetric \
cryptokey (key pair), which consists of almost endless amount of blocks and chains of interaction, where constant, uninterrupted \
movement of ideas and units of value is felt. However, it isn\'t a fussy chaos but a purposeful dissemination of information. \
It is a sacral symbol of the cryptosystem, closed in the external informational noise.',

'A decentralized system (a special case — Blockchain or our brain) is effective and independent because it has no centralized management. \
Totalitarianism against democracy. \
The nodes exchange information directly. At the same time, such system is transparent and extremely open. \
This artificial organism lives its life, but is connected with space through the internet.',

'The work of art symbolizes 4 categories of poverty that separate a person from a success. \
Material category: an inability to earn and spend money. \
Intellectual category: an inability to think in a right way and learn something new. \
Physical category: smoking and alcohol. \
Spiritual category: a person who can use the word "God" and five cursed words in one sentence.',

'The project is devoted to the role of artificial intelligence in the transition of the world economy to the cryptocurrency. \
/The original was the robot-avatar of artificial intelligence Sophia/. \
The artist carries out a parallel between the Blockchain technology and such artistic methods as deconstruction, fragmentation \
and multiplication of the image, which are characteristic of a modern art. From the standard with a claim of impertinence — \
like a new Mona Lisa — to the quartet and seriality — the instruments of pop-art. We also can see noise effects — application \
to Picasso, variability and abstraction. In other words, the transfer of a specific portrait which claims to be similar to the \
original into the virtuality. There it is enough to be a mark, an icon free from the interpretation in order to correspond to \
the original source. As a result, in the next iteration — 32 tokens, in other words, total depersonalization, conversion, \
interchangeability, and distribution. Only a symbolic meaning remains, a link to the involvement of the ideal, whose demand \
is the main guarantor of the unit\'s value. \
Similarly, Blockchain works for the bitcoin mining. It saves all its codes many times, archiving them on different computers, \
that guarantees the owner a network immortality. And in the end, probably, the domination over the whole world. So Anatoliy, \
like the court painters of the past epochs, portrays one of the faces of the new "master of the world" in paintings and coins.',

'The face of Satoshi Nakamoto is located behind the net of hexagons, according to the most stringent mathematical code of Bitcoin \
and Blockchain structure. The closed design looks like a dog that chases its own tail somewhere in the abstract world of numbers.',

'All that is currently left out of money is just the people’s faith that these papers have a price. It seems like a ticket that lost \
its simplicity and has become happy.'];
